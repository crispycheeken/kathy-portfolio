						 Throughout the quarter, I worked with a group of seven fellow students and we were named Potato.
						 We went through a lot of stages to create our product, Idea8, which is a solution to encourage
						 creativity in a timely, collaborative manner.
						 <br>
						 <br>
						 The first stage was Discovery -- What do creative people do? How do creative people become creative,
						 and how do they start executing their creativity. What are the moods associated with this process, and
						 what are the frustrations that follow the initial process? These were the initial questions we used to
						 guide our user research.
					 	</p>
						<span class ="image right">

						</span>
						<p>
							Once we did our user research, we consolidated all of our data into an Affinity Diagram. In order to find
							relationships and deeper themes from our data, we spent a lot of time (and post-its) to organize our data.
							After a Wall Walk of the diagram, we were able to conclude a few things:
							<br><ol>
								<li>Art and Creativity seemed to be intricately linked to self-identity.</li>
								<li>Having structure can either negatively or positively affect creative output.</li>
								<li>There are many places where people can find inspiration, but at times it can
								get pretty overwhelming.</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						<span class ="image right">
							<image src="images/187 ideation.jpg" alt>
						</span>
						<p>
							With the data in mind, we did a couple rounds of Crazy 8's to facilitate our rapid ideation process.
							After around 10 minutes, we each had around 8 ideas, and we discussed certain features that we felt were
							important in addressing the data and user needs.
							<br>
							<br>
							Crazy8's eventually became the inspiration for our actual product, Idea8, which will be explained later.
						</p>
						<br>

						</span>
						<p>
							After ideation, it was time to do our prototype. We each did our own low-fidelity prototypes on pieces
							of paper with various ways of displaying how users would use Crazy8's to facilitate and bring out creativity.
							<br>
							<br>
							We were eventually able to consolidate some features we thought were particularly valuable into one low-fidelity
							prototype. This prototype had the basic ability for the user to:
							<ul>
								<li>choose to work alone or in a group</li>
								<li>create project and start Crazy8 ideation process</li>
								<li>receive feedback from peers.</li>
							</ul>
