						 Throughout the quarter, I worked with a group of seven fellow students and we were named BXSD (Best Experience San Diego).
						 We went through a lot of stages to create our product, e·CLASS·tic, which is a solution to carry your everyday school essentials
						 such as your laptops and notebooks with ease.
						 <br>
						 <br>
						 The first stage was Discovery -- How do people carry their daily things on campus? What kind of people use bags versus backpacks,
						 and how frustrations do they feel when using their carrying device? These were the intitial questions we used to guide our user research.
					 	</p>
						<span class ="image right">

						</span>
						<p>
							Once we did our user research, we consolidated all of our data into an Affinity Diagram. In order to find
							relationships and deeper themes from our data, we spent a lot of time (and post-its) to organize our data.
							After a Wall Walk of the diagram, we were able to conclude a few things:
							<br><ol>
								<li>There are items that people carry that have a higher priority than others (i.e. laptops, charger, notebook, etc.).</li>
								<li>People are frustrated with small items, excess unused items, and smaller pockets in their bags.</li>
								<li>They want their bags to have ease of access, functionality, and less internal, specialized pockets (e.g. pencil pockets).</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						<span class ="image right">
							<image src="images/102 magneato.png" alt>
						</span>
						<p>
							With the data in mind, created a lot of initial backpack prototypes that addressed features that would account
							for user needs. However, we got too caught up in the idea of using a backpack to carry items when in fact the data
							did not reflect the need for a backpack at all, but rather a carrying device that can carry their essentials at school.
							<br>
							<br>
							We created our low-fidelity physical prototype, mag·NEAT·o (which was ideally supposed to have magnets to keep the items together).
							metag·NEAT·o addressed user wants such as organization and accessibility. Its core features include:
							<ul>
								<li>straps to organize their small items</li>
								<li>compact, flippable case to carry their laptop and notebook</li>
								<li>detachable magnet pouch for ease of access to essential items (e.g. computer chargers).</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<span class ="image right">
							<image src="images/102 usertesting.png" alt>
						</span>
						<p>
							We tested mag·NEAT·o during our user testing keeping in mind the Contextual methods of conducting testing, keeping
							in mind the nature of using the carrying device in certain settings such as the classroom or library. We allowed users
							to explore and interact naturally with the prototype while giving feedback.
							<br>
							<br>
							After user testing, we consolidated our data once again came to a few conclusions:
							<ul>
								<li>People liked that it was minimal and compact as well as the flipability of the product.</li>
								<li>People did not like the zipper-positioning, external pouch, and the high learning curve for some features.</li>
								<li>We had to provide options for carrying in different ways and make it minimalistic and easy to use.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<span class ="image right">
							<image src="images/102 eclasstic.png" alt>
						</span>
						<p>
							With all this in mind, we created our second iteration prototype, e·CLASS·tic, which had a few core features:
							<ul>
								<li>Offering different <b>case dimensions</b> to account for laptop sizes</li>
								<li><b>Elastic sides</b> to account for laptop and notebook thickness</li>
								<li><b>Cushion-y</b> interior for protection</li>
								<li><b>Suitcase handle</b> for alternative way to hold case</li>
								<li><b>Detachable straps with triangular hook</b> to carry case like a messenger bag.</li>
								<li><b>Elastic bands in a grid-like formation</b> to carry essentials of various sizes.</li>
								<li><b>Notebook clip</b>to hold notebooks securely</li>
								<li><b>Loose paper flap</b> to prevent paper loss. </li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<br>
							The difference betweeen the two prototypes (i.e. suitcase handle, ability to stretch to account for thickness,etc.)
							were addressed and if are able to continue this project, we could continue iterations until we reach a final project.
							<br>
							<br>
							This class really helped to understand the importance of user research and needfinding, because without this foundation,
							we would have been fixated on the idea of just redesigning a backpack instead of looking back at the user data.
