						<p>

						 Throughout the quarter, I worked with a group of three fellow students.
						 We went through a lot of stages to create our product, Weyaka (a combination of the first two letters of our names),
						  which is a solution to look up all the daily essential information you need to start out your day.
						 <br>
						 <br>
						 <h3><b>The Problem</b></h3>
						 <p>
							 Everyone wakes up and proceeds through their morning routine. Many times,
							 we rush around before we leave the house and often end up to work or school late.
							 A major cause to that is the lack of east to get daily information. For example, a
							 businessman needs to check the traffic on a website, check the weather on another, and
							 then look at his calendar on his phone. A college student needs to know ief he/she needs
							 and umbrella and what his/her first class is. These cumbersome hassles consume much of our
							 precious time in the morning. Thus we developed a way to save time and easily reeive your
							 daily information through Weyaka!
					 	</p>

						</span>
						<h3><b>The Storyboard</b></h3>
						<p>
							We created a storyboard to envision a situation where Weyaka would solve an essential user need.
							This scenario depicts a way a student would utilize this app and ultimately benefit from it because
							he/she can quickly find the information they need.
						</p>

						</span>
						<h3><b>The Paper Prototype</b></h3>
						<p>
							The idea of our homepage was to present information in one glance. Just by looking at this
							screen, a user can see basic information: Weather, Schedule, Traffic, etc. efficiently.
							Here users check the home screen and for detailed information, click on the respective icon.
							From there, they can simply add other options as desired.
						</p>

						<span class ="image right">
							<image src="images/120 prototype.png" alt>
						</span>
						<h3><b>The Functional Prototype</b></h3>
						<p>
							For our functional prototype we picked a more consistent layout in light of heuristic evaluations.
							Our home page consisted of four modules -- Traffic, Weather, Notes, and Schedule. We focused on setting
							our homepage to what it would most probably look like. Our initial prototype had basic navigation between
							the home page and individual module.
						</p>

						</span>
						<h3><b>User Testing</b></h3>
						<p>
							User testing was done two ways in accordance with the requirement.
							 Individual users were asked to accomplish basic tasks covering the functionality of our app and their suggestions
							  were taken into account. A/B testing was carried out with Woopra.com to
								see if our interactive home page made a difference as well to see if users had
								issues navigating by tracking movements through all our major navigation links.
						</p>

						</span>
						<h3><b>The Solution</b></h3>
						<p>
							Weyaka is a daily manager of your day. Weyaka brings a wealth of essential information about your day fast and
							easily. Weyaka provides real time traffic information, up-to-date weather conditions, notes, and your scheduled events.
							No more scrolling, clicking, searching, or fumbling between multiple applications and receive your daily information.
							Weyaka saves users this precious time in the morning and greatly reduces the stress and worry of being late to work or school.
